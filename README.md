Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built from scratch using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch. The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of adversarial training, where a generator and a discriminator compete to produce realistic synthetic data.

Features
Custom-built generator and discriminator models

Training loop with adversarial loss optimization

Visualization of generated samples at different training stages

Easy-to-understand and well-documented code

Usage
Clone the repository

Install dependencies (requirements.txt included)

Run the training script to generate synthetic data
