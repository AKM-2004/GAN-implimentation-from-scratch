# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built from scratch using Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch. The project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of adversarial training, where a generator and a discriminator compete to produce realistic synthetic data.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Custom-built Generator and Discriminator models
- Training loop with adversarial loss optimization
- Visualization of generated samples at different training stages
- Well-documented and modular code for easy understanding
- Flexible to extend for different datasets

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
